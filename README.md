## 📝Objective
The main objective of this project was to analyze HR data and extract meaningful insights to help the organization improve employee retention, optimize recruitment, and enhance workforce performance.

## 🔑Key Tasks Performed
Cleaned and preprocessed the raw HR dataset by handling missing values and removing duplicates

Performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to identify trends such as attrition rate, department-wise performance, and salary distribution

Created visualizations using Python libraries/Power BI/Excel to present key findings

Conducted correlation analysis to determine factors influencing employee attrition and job satisfaction

## 🛠️Tools & Technologies
Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)

Excel for initial data cleaning

Power BI for interactive dashboards

## 📈Key Insights:

Higher attrition rates were observed in departments like Sales and Support

Employees with lower salaries and fewer promotions were more likely to leave

Work-life balance and job satisfaction had a strong impact on employee retention

## 🏆Outcome
### ☂️ Comprehensive Understanding of Workforce Trends

Through EDA and summary statistics, the HR team gained a clear view of employee demographics, department distributions, salary structures, and attrition patterns.

Visualizations made it easier to identify high-risk departments (Sales, Support) and groups (employees with lower salaries and fewer promotions).

### 🎹Identification of Key Attrition Drivers

Correlation analysis revealed that salary hikes, promotion history, work-life balance, and job satisfaction are the strongest factors impacting retention.

Younger employees with shorter tenure had a significantly higher turnover rate compared to senior employees.

### 🌿 Predictive Insights with a Classification Model

A predictive model (e.g., Logistic Regression/Decision Tree) was developed to classify employees as ‘likely to stay’ or ‘likely to leave.’

The confusion matrix showed the model’s ability to correctly predict employee attrition with measurable accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

This helps HR proactively identify employees at risk of leaving and intervene with retention strategies.

### 🧑‍💻 Interactive Decision Support

A Power BI dashboard was created for continuous monitoring of key HR metrics, enabling managers to quickly spot trends and make informed decisions.
